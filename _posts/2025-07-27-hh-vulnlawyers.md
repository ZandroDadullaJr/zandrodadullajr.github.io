VulnLawyers is a Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenge hosted on the HackingHub platform. It simulates a realistic web application environment, inviting participants to identify and exploit common security flaws in authentication, data exposure, and access control.

In this write-up, I've created a Web Application Penetration Test report for the VulnLawyers CTF, making it as realistic as possible using the current knowledge I have in creating a penetration test report. I used the template from TCM Security when I created the report. You can find the template [here](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/TCM-Security-Sample-Pentest-Report).

The report below was one of the three winners of the [Hackinghub](https://app.hackinghub.io/) and Hack Smarter Penetration Test report contest. Feel free to watch the video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/2r4mz8JQp0k?t=2122).
