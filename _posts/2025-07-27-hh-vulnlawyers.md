# VulnLawyers
VulnLawyers is a Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenge hosted on the HackingHub platform. It simulates a realistic web application environment, inviting participants to identify and exploit common security flaws in authentication, data exposure, and access control.

In this writeup I've create a Web Application Penetration Test report for the VulnLawyers CTF making it as realistic as possible using the current knowledge I have in creating a penetration test report. I've used the template from TCM Security when I created the report. You can find the template [here](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/TCM-Security-Sample-Pentest-Report).
